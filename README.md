        <h2>What It Does: Automated Duo 2FA</h2>
        <p>The **Auto Duo Helper** automates the process of completing Duo Security's two-factor authentication (2FA), streamlining your login experience.</p>
        <p>It works by intercepting the Duo prompt and automatically approving the login request, typically via a method like a simulated **Duo Push**, allowing you to bypass manual interaction with your mobile device.</p>
